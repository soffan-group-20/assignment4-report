## Project

Name: Teammates

URL: https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates

TEAMMATES is a free online tool for managing peer evaluations and other feedback paths of your students. It is provided as a cloud-based service for educators/students and is currently used by hundreds of universities across the world.

## Onboarding experience

We decided to continue on the same project hence the onboarding experience remains the same as the last time. Our onboarding [Onboarding expeirence TEAMMATES](https://github.com/soffan-group-20/teammates/issues/1)

## Effort spent

For each team member, how much time was spent in

1. plenary discussions/meetings;

2. discussions within parts of the group;

3. reading documentation;

4. configuration and setup;

5. analyzing code/output;

6. writing documentation;

7. writing code;

8. running code?

For setting up tools and libraries (step 4), enumerate all dependencies
you took care of and where you spent your time, if that time exceeds
30 minutes.

## Overview of issue(s) and work done.

#### Title: Add 'course -> copy' option to the instructor home page

URL:

Summary & scope:
Summary in one or two sentences

Scope (functionality and code affected).

#### Title: Instructor viewing results of rubric questions: missing space after checkbox

URL:

Summary & scope: There should be a space between a checkbox and a text, this will not impact functionallity but is a visual improvement and affects the file `rubric-question-statistics.component.html`.

## Requirements for the new feature or requirements affected by functionality being refactored
* There is a "copy" option on the instructor home page, it should have the same behavior as currently implemented on "courses" page.
* Button should have related tests

Optional (point 3): trace tests to requirements.

## Code changes

### Patch

(copy your changes or the add git command to show them)

git diff ...

Optional (point 4): the patch is clean.

Optional (point 5): considered for acceptance (passes all automated checks).

## Test results

Overall results with link to a copy or excerpt of the logs (before/after
refactoring).

## UML class diagram and its description

### Key changes/classes affected

Optional (point 1): Architectural overview.

Optional (point 2): relation to design pattern(s).

## Overall experience

#### What are your main take-aways from this project? What did you learn?

#### How did you grow as a team, using the Essence standard to evaluate yourself?

Going through the Essence team checklist we established that we are currently in the Performing state. We have been able to successfully implement a way of working and have trust in each other as a team to take responsibility and do the work needed in a cohesive manner. We are at a stage where we are now performing tasks and identifying, addressing, and eliminating potential problems within the team and as we are now close to finishing the course and the assignments, we place ourselves in the Performing state. What hinders from reaching the last state Adjourned is being fully complete with the assignment. When this last assignment has been submitted and graded we can fulfil the requirements for the last state and see ourselves as done.

As the group has gotten to know each other better I think we have improved, both individually and as a team. For example, we have realized our strengths and weaknesses, allowing us to work more efficient and find tools and techniques which benefits our working process. We have also been able to improve communication and collaboration within the team. Despite making great progress in throughout the course there is always more ways to improve. We are certain we could, if we were to continue working together for a longer period of time, optimize our way of working further and ultimately develop a more efficient process within the team. One of the things we believe can be improved even more is assessing ourselves and our work. For example, by making it a habit in our way of working to continuously pause and assess ourselves and our tools and techniques. In the same way we believe communication within the team could be improved further by making it a habit to have team regular team meetings and keeping each other up to date to everyoneâ€™s status.

#### Optional (point 6): How would you put your work in context with best software engineering practice?

#### Optional (point 7): Is there something special you want to mention here?
